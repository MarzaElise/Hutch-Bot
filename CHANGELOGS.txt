**New Commands**:
---- Redo -> reply to one of **your** previous message to reinvoke a command. ||[not documented]||
---- Delete -> delete a message sent by the bot. Helpful when the bot unexpectedly sends something unwanted.
---- Source -> view the source of a specific command. Will be adding checks later.

**Updated**:
---- Whois -> Reformatted the whois command.
---- More error handling 
----    -> Now the bot handles errors that occur when trying to send text with more than 2000 characters and stuff

**Extra**:
---- The official documentation of the bot is now released at https://hutch-bot.readthedocs.io
---- This update took longer than I expected since I was doing the documentation
---- Bot's source is now open for everyone to view at <https://github.com/MarzaElise/Hutch-Bot>
---- Warn commands that were under testing will be removed soon in the next update.
---- Will be moving blacklist data and dm command opt out data to database :pog_shake:
---- Since redo command is added now, you no longer can edit the message to reinvoke a command. That method is now restrcited to only me

||sorry for taking too long||
