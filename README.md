## Self Hosting

This repository doesnt support self hosting and i dont have any intentions to do so in the future.

## Features

Hutch Bot has many features. Here are some of the top ones...

1. Auto Moderation

    - Hutch Bot has awesome auto moderation which is one of the things I personally love the most.

    - This includes a profanity filter which is not toggleable as im writing this, but I do have an idea to make it toggleable.

    - Auto moderation also includes an **`@everyone`** and **`@here`** filter. This would kick any user who pings **`@everyone`** or **`@here`** without the proper permissions

2. Fun Commands

    - There are many fun commands binded to hutch bot. Here are some of the APIs I used to make them.

    - [Some Random API](https://some-random-api.ml/)

        - Used by **`wink`**, **`pat`**, **`hug`** and similar commands.

    - [randomness API](https://randomness-api.herokuapp.com/)

        - Used for the **`fact`** and **`website`** commands. This is also made by me and it happens to be open source too. you can view it by clicking [here](https://github.com/MarzaElise/randomness-api).

## Extra

Here are some extra facts and information that are good to know

- This repository has a ton of messy code.

- It took 10 days to make me functional, from then there were only minor updates and bug fixes.

- Hutch Bot's message cache is capped at 1k and it only has members privileged intent enabled.

- Official documentation for this bot is also available now. It is also made by me and you can visit it by clicking [here](https://marzaelise.github.io/Hutch-Bot/). Note that some command categories havent been added

- This repository will not be accepting pull requests, however I will merge pull requests that reduce my messy code. (please help me fix my code)

- Fun Fact: Wild dogs and Hyenas eat their prey alive, so try not to get eaten by one
